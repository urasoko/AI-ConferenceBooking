# Cursor Rules 

## Security-First Development Workflow

### Mandatory Security Scanning
- Use other classes to implement similar code.
- **CRITICAL**: If any new first-party code is written, immediately run Snyk Code security scan
- If security issues are returned based on newly introduced or modified code only, attempt to fix those issues only
- Rescan the code after fixing issues to ensure they were resolved and no new issues were introduced
- Repeat this process until no newly added code issues are found
- Always provide a summary at the end: how many issues were found and how many were fixed
